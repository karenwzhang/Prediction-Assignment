# Prediction-Assignment
In this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which 
they did the exercise, correspoding to the variable "class" in the data set. We train 3 models: decesion tree, random forest, and gradient
boost tree using k-folds cross validation on the training data set. Based on the accuracy and out-of-sample error, we select the best model 
and use it to predict the test data set.
